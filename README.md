# WP-GEB-Estimator-2

A tool for estimating WP-GEB (Weight-Perturbed GEneralization Bounds)
of neural classifiers

# Requirements

WP-GEB-Estimator is described in the Python language
with the libraries TensorFlow and NumPy.
The software versions used in the development are
Python 3.10.16, TensorFlow 2.16.2, and NumPy 1.26.4. 
The file "[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)" was generated by "pip freeze"
in our environment (macOS: Sonoma, CPU: Apple M2 Max).
