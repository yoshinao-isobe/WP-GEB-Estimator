Searching adversarial perturbations:


Perturbation ratio = 0.0
  The number of data whose adversarial perturbations are found:
    by gradient-search: 0/4833
    by gradient-search and random-sample: 167/5000
  (Elapsed Time: 0.0 [sec])

Perturbation ratio = 0.01
  The number of data whose adversarial perturbations are found:
    by gradient-search: 990/4822
    by gradient-search and random-sample: 1168/5000
  (Elapsed Time: 63.7 [sec])

Perturbation ratio = 0.1
  The number of data whose adversarial perturbations are found:
    by gradient-search: 4677/4682
    by gradient-search and random-sample: 4995/5000
  (Elapsed Time: 59.4 [sec])

Perturbation ratio = 1.0
  The number of data whose adversarial perturbations are found:
